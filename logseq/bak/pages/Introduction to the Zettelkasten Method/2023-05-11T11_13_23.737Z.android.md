- ## Introduction
	- [[zettelkasten method]] is useful to organize knowledge inside a [[digital garden]]
	- *"A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection"*
		-
	- [[zettelkasten method]] took of thanks to [[Niklas Luhmann]]
	-
- ## Luhmann's Zettelkasten
	- Luhmann used paper slips as [[hypertext]] to easily navigate his notes
	- A [[hypertext]] should be surfable in order to be effective
	- Nowadays digital software allow people to manage their [[digital garden]] in a more efficient way
	-
- ## Why the [[zettelkasten method]] is interesting?
	- It is more efficient (not easier btw) than traditional note taking methods
	- It helps us to improve our note taking techniques in several ways:
		- #### Improve the connectivity of thoughts
			- Using [[hypertext]] we can connect ideas in a straightorward way
			- Thought connections make new insights possible
		- #### Be more productive
			- Entering [[productivity]] flow is easier
		- #### Stop wasting efforts
			- You prepare the notes for future uses
			- Improve the depth of processing information from that topic
		- #### Scaling
			- Traditional note taking will slowly create a bloated mess difficult to navigate
			- [[zettelkasten method]] scales automatically based on thought connections
			-
- ## The fixed address of each note
	- In order to refer to an individual note, it has to be unique
		- #### It makes [[organic growth]] possible
			- It works like a wiki
			- Using [[hypertext]] allows you to expand "vertically" on a specific topic, branching the current page
		- #### It improves [[linked thinking]]
			- The non linear link structure is the main trait of [[hypertext]]
			- *"It is not important where you place a note once it is properly linked with other knowledge nodes"*
	- Once notes were made surfable, Luhmann needed to create a search engine for his notes
	- He used his register as his [[entry points]] catalog
	- In order to access notes, you should create [[entry points]]
	- By doing so you limit the access to notes via the most central pages on a topic
	- Luhmann's register was only a list of possible [[entry points]] to the biggest and most important clusters of notes. After finding the entry he relied on on the linking system and began to surf
	-
- ## The 3 principles of [[zettelkasten method]]
	- #### It's hypertextual
		- A collection of text is linear
		- A collection of [[hypertext]] allows the [[organic growth]]
	- #### Should adhere to the [[principle of atomicity]]
		- Each thought should be [[atomic]]
		- Atomicity allows [[linked thinking]]
	- #### Should be [[personal]]
		- Links inside your [[digital garden]] should be personal
		- The [[linked thinking]] is based upon personal relations between thoughts
		- You should not copy and paste other people thoughts
-
- ## The structure of a [[zettel]]
	- #### ID
		- Each [[zettel]] should have an ID
		- This allows connections between thoughts #[[linked thinking]]
	- #### Body
		- It should be composed of [[atomic]] thoughts
		- It should be written using your own words
	- #### References
		- A [[zettel]] is nothing without references to other thougths
		- References are the foundametal block of any [[digital garden]]
-
- ## Structure notes
	- [[zettelkasten method]] should not only be a web of thoughts
	- [[zettelkasten method]] should integrate an [[hierarchical]] structure to easily surf notes
	- It should implement [[hub notes]] that behave as [[entry points]] to deeper knowledge
