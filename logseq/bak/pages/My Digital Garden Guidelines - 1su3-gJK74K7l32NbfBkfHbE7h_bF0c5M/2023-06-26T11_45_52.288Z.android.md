- In this document I will explain the basic structure of my [[digital garden]]
-
- ## The Structure
	- My [[digital garden]] is based upon a personal version of the [[PARA method]]
	- I decided to adopt the following catagories to divide my digital life
		- ### Resources
			- This category contains every piece of long-term knowledge (e.g. book notes, blog posts notes, etc...)
			-
		- ### Areas Of Responsibility
			- This category contains the pillars of my life, the bone structure of anything else
			- A typical area of responsibility, like [[health]] for example, has a standard to mantain not a goal to be achieved.
			- It this section I journal about different aspects about my life and I try to understand which things I have to improve or change in order to live a fulfilling and balanced life
			- By looking at the journals I can see in which aspects of my life I perform better and in which I perform worse and, most important, I can than use the "Projects" section to take action and try to balance my life
			-
		- ### Projects
			- This category contains the plans for reaching every goal that I want to accomplish in a certain deadline
			- A typical project, like a [[software development]] project (building a SaaS), has a goal to be achieved in a certain period of time, not a standard to mantain
			- In this section, for example, I take the things that I realized had to improve in the "Areas Of Responsibility" section and I create a plan in order to fulfill that need of improvement.
			  (e.g. if I realize that I need to spend more time with my family, in the Projects section I will create a clear goal, a deadline and a plan to follow in order to fulfill that desire)
			-
		- ### Templates
			- This category was created solely to fulfill a technical need
			- In this category I manage every template used inside of the [[digital garden]]
			- Templates are used to standardize data and facilitate posthumous aggregation and query

- ## Why a [[digital garden]]?
	- Early on in my life (at 18 years old) I understood that I needed a place to store and link in a persistent way my current and future [[knowledge]]
	- Being born in 2004 means being constantly exposed to a continuos [[stream]] of content, which for the 90% is pure [[noise]] and [[distraction]]. The sad thing is that before having a [[digital garden]] I lost in the noise even the good quality content. I had to absolutely find a way to drain that lost of [[knowledge]]
	- I also liked the idea of giving to my future children, and loved ones in general, the possibility to interact with my [[knowledge]] and life experiences even when I will not be alive anymore
