- ## What is an Algorithm?
	- It is a procedure to accomplish a specific task.
	- It should solve a general, well specified [[problem]]. AKA it should solve every [[instance]] of the given problem
	- A good [[algorithm]] should be [[correct]], [[efficient]] and the [[implementation]] has to be easy
	- Correct algorithms usually come with a proof of correctness
	- You should aim at developing [[algorithms]], not [[heuristics]], even if heuristics may usually do a good job, it is not guaranteed
	- Ensuring the optimal answer over all possible inputs is a difficult but often achievable goal. Seek to [[problem]] [[instance]]s that breaks the algorithm
	-
- ## Correctness Demonstration Tools:
	- ### Correctness Proof
		- A mathematical [[proof]] is composed by a clear [[statement]], a set of [[assumptions]] involved in the process of proving the statement and than a [[chain of reasoning]] which takes you from the assumptions to the statement you are trying to prove
		-
	- ### Expressing Algorithms
		- Before even trying to write an [[algorithm]] in a [[programming language]] , you should think carefully about the sequence of [[steps]] to be performed
		- The heart of any [[algorithm]] is the fundamental idea. If your idea is not clearly revealed when you express an algorithm, then you are using too low-level a notation to describe it
		-
	- ### Problem description and Properties
		- In order to develop a correct [[algorithm]], you should first focus on understanding the problem description and requirements
		- Problem specifications have two parts:
			- #### Set of allowed input instances
				- Narrow the set of allowable input instances until there is a [[correct]] and [[efficient]] [[algorithm]]. (eg: we can restrict a graph problem from general graphs down to binary trees)
			- #### Required properties of the algorithm's output
				- Requirements should be clear and well defined (eg: asking for the "best" route between two places is a silly question. Define what do you mean with "best", it can mean the fastest, or the cheapest, etc...)
				- Avoid creating compound [[goals]]. (eg: "Find the shortest path from a to b (1), that doesn't use more than twice as many turns as necessary (2)". Here there are two goals compounded)
				- Finding the right formulation for your problem is an important part of solving it
				-
- ## Incorrectness Demonstration Tools
	- The best way to prove that an [[algorithm]] is [[incorrect]] is to produce an [[instance]] in which it yields an incorrect answer. This instance is called a [[counter-example]]
