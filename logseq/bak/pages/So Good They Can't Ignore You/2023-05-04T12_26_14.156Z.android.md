-
- ## Introduction
	- The author describes the "fallacy" of finding the dream job that matches a pre-existing [[passion]]
	- The traits that define a good job are [[rare]] and [[valuable]] and you need [[rare]] and [[valuable]] [[skills]] to exchange with those great traits
	- The author divides the book in 4 major rules that one should follow in order to fully understand how to land a good job
-
- ## Rule 1
	- This rule argues that the [[passion hypotesis]] is a bad and dangerous advice
	- There is little evidence that people have pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered and transformed in jobs
	- Believing that there's a magical right job lurking out there can often lead to chronic [[unhappiness]] and [[confusion]] when the reality of the working world fails to match this dream.
	-
- ## Rule 2
	- This rule discuss what you should be focusing on instead of following a, so called, pre-existing passion
	- It contended that the the traits that defines a good job are [[rare]] and [[valuable]]
	- If you want those traits, you need [[rare]] and [[valuable]] [[skills]] to offer in return
	- The author defines those [[rare]] and [[valuable]] [[skills]] as [[career capital]]
	- In order to acquire [[career capital]] you need to shift your mindset from the [[passion mindset]] to the [[craftman mindset]]
	- The [[craftman mindset]] is not enough, to help the efforts of becoming "so good they can't ignore you" at something you should constatly do [[deliberate practice]]
	-
- ## Rule 3
	- This rule discuss how to invest the [[career capital]] once you earned it
	- It argues that investing your [[career capital]] in gaining more [[control]] over what you do and how you do it is incredibly important
	- [[control]] is a [[rare]] and [[valuable]] [[trait]]
	- The author refers to [[control]] with the term [[dream job elixir]]
	- There are 2 [[control traps]] that you will encounter when trying to gain more [[control]]:
		- #### The first control trap:
			- It's dangerous to try to gain more [[control]] without enough [[career capital]] to back it up
		- #### The second control trap:
			- Once you have the [[career capital]] to back up a bid for more [[control]] your employer will likely fight to keep you on a more traditional path. He realizes that your request is good for you but not for his bottom line
		- Both of these traps leads to failure, they should be noticed and avoided at all costs
	- To determine when you have enough [[career capital]] to support a bid for more [[control]] you should cosider the [[law of financial viability]]
	- Unless people are willing to pay you, it's not an idea you are ready to go after
	-
- ## Rule 4
	- This rule discuss the importance of [[mission]] and describes it as a [[rare]] and [[valuable]] [[trait]]
	- As every other [[trait]], you need to cash in [[career capital]] in order to get it without failing
	- You can't develop a [[mission]] without first building mastery in your field
	- The best ideas for a [[mission]] are found in the [[adjacent possible]]
	- To encounter those ideas you should alredy be in the cutting edge of your field, which requires [[career capital]]
	- Once you found a [[mission]] you need to generate concrete [[feedback]] using the so called [[little bets]] strategy
	- Use the [[feedback]] to understand what to do next, and proceed with little steps to success
	- To tranform a mission into a success, and apply it correctly to your working enviroment you should follow the [[law of remarkability]]
