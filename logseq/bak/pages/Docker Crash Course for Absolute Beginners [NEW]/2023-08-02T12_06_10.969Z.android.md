- ## What is [[Docker]]
	- It is an [[open source]] software that facilitates the development and deployment of applications
	- It is based upon the [[container]] concept
	-
- ## What problems [[Docker]] solves
	- ### Avoid local services installation
		- Before Docker, an entire team had to locally install each service needed for the application development
		- The problem is that installation may go wrong, or different components of the team may have different version of the same service (example: Alice has PostgreSQL version 1 installed, and John has PostgreSQL version 2 installed)
		- Using [[container]] will standardize this process. Each member of the team will download and start the isolated [[container]] of the service
		- Using this approach teams do not have to bother with local files configuration and installation
		- Using [[container]] you can have more version of the same service active without conflicts, which is very difficult to achive with local installation of the service itself
		-
	- ### Simplify the deployment
		- Before Docker, in order to deploy an application a team had to create an artifact containing the application source code and the config files for the installation
		- Than the artifact had to be delivered to the Ops team, which proceeded with the direct intallation and configuration of the application on the server [[OS]]
		- Using [[container]] solves the problem because it contains everything needed to run the application, the Ops team does not have to manually install on the server OS the dependencies, etc...
		- The Ops team has to install the [[Docker runtime]] on the server, then it will manage the containers as isolated lightweight enviroments
		-
- ## [[Virtual Machine]] vs [[Docker]]
	- Both technologies are used to virtualize the [[OS]]
	- [[Virtual Machine]] virtualizes the entire [[OS]]. On the phisical server is installed a [[Hypervisor]] that manages the communication and resource partitioning between each individual VM. Each VM has its own [[OS Kernel]]
	- [[Docker]] virtualizes only the [[OS Applications Layer]], which means that every [[container]] will share the same [[OS Kernel]]

	-
	- The booting process of a [[container]] is faster than the one of a [[Virtual Machine]] because it doesn't have to boot up an entire [[OS Kernel]] every time
	- The size of a [[container]] is less than the one of a [[Virtual Machine]] because it doesn't contain the [[OS Kernel]]
	- A [[container]] based upon [[Windows OS]] cannot be booted on a server based on a [[Linux]] [[OS Kernel]]. A [[Virtual Machine]] is totally hardware indipendent because it has its own [[OS Kernel]]
	- Using [[Docker Desktop]] is possible (but not suggested) to boot [[Linux]] based [[container]] on [[Windows OS]] or [[macOS]]
