	- ### How a C++ program runs
	  collapsed:: true
		- The source code gets involved in 3 main operations before becoming ready for execution
		- #### Translation phase
			- In this phase the code gets ready to be compiled
			- A code file that is gone through the translation process is called translation unit
			-
		- #### Compilation of *.cpp* files
			- The compiler program compiles each *.cpp* file into *.o* files

			-
		- #### Linking of *.o* files
			- A program called â€œlinker" links all the *.o* files and all the libraries together and creates an executable file *.exe*

	- ### [[variables]] [[initialization]]
		- It is the process in which variables are created
		- In this process a value is assigned (manually or by default) to the variable
		- #### Default Initialization #[[bad practice]]
			- ```C++
			  int num;
			  ```
		-
		- #### Copy Initialization #[[bad practice]]
			- It is more of a [[C]] way of initializing variables
			- ```C++
			  int num = 1;
			  ```
		-
		- #### Direct Initialization #[[bad practice]]
			- ```C++
			  int num(1);
			  ```
		-
	- #### Zero Initialization #[[good practice]]
		- It is useful when you plan to immediately replace the value of the variable
		- In other words, you don't care which value is assigned to the variable because it will be assigned after the variable initialization
		- ```C++
		  int num{};
		  std::cin >> num;  // The value is immediately replaced by the value inserted using "cin"
		  ```
		-
		- #### Value Initialization #[[good practice]]
			- It is useful when you need a default value for the variable
			- ```C++
			  int num{ 1 };
			  ```
		-
		- #### Unused Variable #[[good practice]]
			- It is useful when we are dealing with a *maybe unused* variable
			- If the variable might be unused, and we didn't wrote the maybe_unused keyword, the compiler may throw an error
			- ```C++
			  [[maybe_unused]] int num{};  // Or num{ 1 } for example, it doesn't matter
			  ```
