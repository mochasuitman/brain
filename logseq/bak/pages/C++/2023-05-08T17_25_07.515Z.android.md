	- ### How a C++ program runs
	  collapsed:: true
		- The source code gets involved in 3 main operations before becoming ready for execution
		- #### Translation phase
			- In this phase the code gets ready to be compiled
			- A code file that is gone through the translation process is called translation unit
			-
		- #### Compilation of *.cpp* files
			- The [[compiler]] program compiles each *.cpp* file into *.o* files
			- ![cpp-compilation.png](../assets/cpp-compilation_1683319562030_0.png){:height 194, :width 445}
			-
		- #### Linking of *.o* files
			- A program called [[linker]] links all the *.o* files and all the libraries together and creates an executable file *.exe*
			- ![cpp-linking.png](../assets/cpp-linking_1683319581098_0.png)
		-
	- ### [[variables]] [[initialization]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- It is the process in which variables are created
		- In this process a value is assigned (manually or by default) to the variable
		- #### Default Initialization #[[bad practice]]
			- ```C++
			  int x;
			  ```
			-
		- #### Copy Initialization #[[bad practice]]
			- It is more of a [[C]] way of initializing variables
			- ```C++
			  int x = 1;
			  ```
			-
		- #### Direct Initialization #[[bad practice]]
			- ```C++
			  int x(1);
			  ```
			-
		- #### Zero Initialization #[[good practice]]
			- It is useful when you plan to immediately replace the value of the variable
			- In other words, you don't care which value is assigned to the variable because it will be assigned after the variable initialization
			- ```C++
			  int x {};
			  std::cin >> x;  // The value is immediately replaced by the value inserted using "cin"
			  ```
			-
		- #### Value Initialization #[[good practice]]
			- It is useful when you need a default value for the variable
			- ```C++
			  int x { 1 };
			  ```
			-
		- #### Unused Variable #[[good practice]]
			- It is useful when we are dealing with a *maybe unused* variable
			- If the variable might be unused, and we didn't wrote the maybe_unused keyword, the compiler may throw an error
			- ```C++
			  [[maybe_unused]] int x {};  // Or x{ 1 } for example, it doesn't matter
			  ```
			-
	- ### New line character
	  collapsed:: true
		- #### '\\n' escape character #[[bad practice]]
			- It is preferable for permormance reasons
			- It is preferable for readability reasons
			- ```C++
			  std::cout << '\n';
			  ```
			-
		- #### endl #[[bad practice]]
			- ```C++
			  std::cout << endl;
			  ```
			-
	- ### [[operators]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Every operator returns a value, it may be not used explicitly by the user though
		- #### Operators that explicitly return a value
			- ```C++
			  +; -; *; /;  // etc...
			  ```
			-
		- #### Operators that implicitly return a value
			- ```C++
			  <<; >>; =;  // etc...
			  ```
			-
		- #### Chaining operators one another
			- Operators can be chained
			- ```C++
			  int x = (3 + 1);  // (3 + 1) = 4 --> x = 4 --> Value of x is 4
			  int x = y = 5;  // y = 5 --> x = y --> Value of x is 5
			  std::cout << (x = 2);  // x = 2 --> cout << x --> Value printed is 2
			  ```
			-
	- ### [[undefined behaviour]] (UB)
	  collapsed:: true
		- ```C++
		  int x;  // Default Initialization
		  std::cout << x;
		  ```
		- This code will produce an undefined behaviour
		- The variable *x* will apparently store a random value, but it is not random.
		- The value of x is the value allocated at the memory space that is now pointed by the pointer "int *pX;"
		- Before the program started, that memory space was used by other programs or the OS
		- It means that default initialization does not allocate any value inside the memory space, it only reserve a space in memory for later use
		-
	- ### [[functions]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- ```C++
		  #include <iostream>
		  
		  void sayHi() {
		  	std::cout << "Hi!\n";
		  }
		  ```
		-
		- Once created a function can be reused everywhere inside the codebase
		- ```C++
		  int main() {
		    	sayHi();
		  	return 0;
		  }
		  ```
		-
		- #### Nested functions
		  collapsed:: true
			- In C++ nested functions are NOT supported
			- You can't define a function inside another function
			-
		- #### [[parameters]] and [[arguments]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- ```C++
			  #include <iostream>
			  
			  void printNum(int x) {  // (int x) is called "parameter"
			    std::cout << x << '\n';
			  }
			  
			  int main() { 
			  	printNum(10);  // (10) is called "argument"
			    	return 0;
			  }
			  ```
			-
			- When a function is called, all of the parameters of the function are created as variables, the value of each argument is copied into the matching parameter
			- In memory there will be 2 variables with different addresses but same value
			- The parameter will be destroyed after the function ends, but the argument passed from the caller function will not be destroyed
			- When you want to update a value from a separate function, you should pass the [[pointer]] to the variable
			- ```C++
			  #include <iostream>
			  
			  void updateNum(int *pX) {
			    	*pX = 10;
			  }
			  
			  int main() {
			  	int x { 1 };
			    	updateNum(&x);
			  }
			  ```
			-
		- #### [[out of scope]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- ```C++
			  #include <iostream>
			  
			  int printNum() {
			  	std::cout << "Number: " << x << '\n';  // [ERROR] --> 'x' is out of scope
			  }
			  
			  int main() {
			    	int x { 10 };
			    	printNum();
			    	return 0;
			  }
			  ```
				-
		- #### [[going out of scope]]
		  collapsed:: true
			- ```C++
			  #include <iostream>
			  
			  int main() {
			    	int x { 2 };
			  	return 0;  	
			  }
			  // Here the variable x is going out of scope, end of the curly braces
			  ```
			-
	- ### [[namespace]]
		- ```C++
		  std::cout  // "std" is the "C++ Standard Library" namespace
		  ```
		-
		- Using namespaces means that you can define functions with the same name as long as those functions live in different namespaces
		-
		- #### "using namespace" command #[[bad practice]]
			- It is preferable to not use *"using namespace"* command
			- You should avoid using this command in order to avoid [[naming collisions]]
			- ```C++
			  using namespace std;
			  
			  int main() {
			  	cout << "Hello World!\n";  // You don't explicitly know where "cout" is declared
			    	return 0;
			  }
			  ```
