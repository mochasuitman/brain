- ## Introduction
	- The author states that [[procrastination]] is not always a bad thing
	- The author thinks that is impossible to not procrastinate, one should foucus on doing it well instead of thinking about how to avoid it
	-
- ## The 3 types of procrastinators
	- Depending on what a procrastinator does while procrastinating it falls into one of those categories:
		- #### Type A:
			- The procrastinator that works on nothing
		- #### Type B:
			- The procrastinator that works on something less important
		- #### Type C:
			- The procrastinator that works on something more important
				- This is defined as good [[procrastination]]
				- Those people are those who put off working on [[small stuff]] to work on [[big stuff]]
				- Their mind is absent from the everyday world because is focused on working on much more important stuff
				-
- Good [[procrastination]] is avoiding [[errands]] to do [[real work]]
-
- ## Why should you focus on [[real work]] instead of [[errands]]
	- Beyond being an overall better long-term investment, it is more important because:
		- #### It requires big chunks of [[time]]
		- #### It requires the right [[mood]]
	- Both of those [[trait]] are not always avaible to us
	- Forcing someone to perform [[errands]] will inevitably limit his/her [[productivity]]
	- [[errands]] are considered as interruptions that limit your workflow
	- The reason why [[startups]] are more productive in the first period is because no one is interrupting the founders work
-
- A lot of times we let [[errands]] eat up our time to avoid facing a hard problem. It is our [[fault]]
-
- ## The worst procrastinator type
	- The worst procrastinator is the Type B because it doesn't feel like [[procrastination]]
	- Type B procrastinator gets the things done. Just the wrong (less important) things
-
- To fight against [[procrastination]] you should ask yourself *"What's the best thing I could be working on, and why I'm not working on it?"*
-
- ## The difficulty of working on hard [[problem]]
	- When we encounter hard [[problem]] we tend to fall in [[procrastination]]
	- To do [[real work]] you have to find good [[project]], but the difficult part is forcing yourself to work on it even if you are facing hard [[problem]]
	- The main reason is that working on hard [[problem]] is neither [[comfortable]] nor enjoiable. It requires to stretch your [[abilities]], as mentioned for the concept of [[deliberate practice]]
	- We prefer to work on simpler tasks because we prefer a short-term accomplishment feeling instead of a long-term reward
	- Facing big and hard [[problem]] is [[terrifying]]. It is why we prefer avoid them
-
- ## How to face hard [[problem]]
	- *"Looking too directly in the eye of the big problem is terrifying, almost paralyzing"*
	- You have to approach the [[problem]] somewhat obliquely, adjusting the angle while proceeding in the development of the solution if you don't want to get paralyzed by it
	- To approach a difficult [[problem]] you can generally adopt 2 tricks:
		- #### Split the hard [[problem]] into simpler ones
			- *"Divide et impera"*
		- #### Split the moral load with collaborators
