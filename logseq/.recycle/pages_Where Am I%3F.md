- "Where Am I?" is a series of pages in which I try to do a little bit of [[introspection]] about how my life is going, which "Areas Of Responsibility" I should focus more in order to have a more balanced life
- In those pages I will try to examine and ask periodically the general question: "How life is going?"
- I will write a new "Where Am I?" page everytime I feel stressed out, whenever I need to make some changes in my life or in general whenever i feel like it
- I will try as hard as I can to have a stoic approach #stoicism. I will try to analyze and suggest to do [[rational]] actions based upon a detached and objective view of my life
