- ## How to take notes from books
	- Highlight the crucial informations
	- Write side page notes
	- Create your own [[table of contents]] in the front pages of the book
	- In the last blank pages of the book write down the [[lessons]] that the book teached you
	- Write down at the end of the book how you want to apply the [[lessons]] teached in your life
	- Write down the date in which you started the book
	- Write down the date in which you finished the book
	-
- ## When to take notes
	- [[highlight]] text and write [[side page notes]] when you finished to read a page, otherwise the risk is to break the reading flow
	- After a [[concept]] is totally explained (usually it means at the end of each chapter) add a reference to it inside the [[table of contents]] (e.g. "Pag 48: The importance of reading").
	- Rewrite in your own words in the blank pages at end of the book the [[lessons]] learned

- ## How to plant notes inside your [[digital garden]]
	- Reread the [[table of contents]], the [[lessons]], the [[highlight]] text and the [[side page notes]], than patiently plant the knowledge inside the [[digital garden]]
	- If the content is digital, you can take notes inside your basic note taking app but then you should give it a structure and add it to the [[digital garden]]
