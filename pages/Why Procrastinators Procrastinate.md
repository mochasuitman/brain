- ## Introduction
	- "Avoid procrastinating" is a good advice only for fake procrastinators. [[procrastination]] isn't something optional for real procrastinators
	- To understand how a procrastinator mind works, one should know how a non procrastinator brain works
	-
- ## The brain of a non procrastinator
	- Inside the non procrastinator brain lives only the [[rational decision maker]]
	- He has full control upon your actions
	-
- ### The brain of a procrastinator
	- Three entities live inside the procrastinator brain:
		- The [[rational decision maker]]
		- The [[instant gratification monkey]]
		- The [[panic monster]]
		-
- ## The 3 procrastination [[problem]]
	- The procrastinator has 3 good reason to change his way of life:
		- #### Procrastinator's life is unpleasant
			- He lives constantly in [[fear]] of the sudden awaken of the [[panic monster]]. He can't really enjoy his time
			- The procrastinator life is led by [[fear]] and [[unhappiness]]
		- #### Procrastinator ultimately sells himself short
			- He does only what is [[urgent]] instead of focusing on what is [[important]]
			- This happens beacuse he does things only when scared by a deadline
		- #### The have-to-dos may happen, but not the want-to-dos
			- Even if the procrastinator handles every task he needs to do, he can't really focus on what is [[important]]
			- This happens because the [[panic monster]] doesn't get involved in long term goals
